# Linux Command Line Snippet

## Introduction

Here I put some frequent command I used

### Count the files in a directory

```ls directory | wc -l```

Note:

`ls:` list files in dir

`-1:` (that's a ONE) only one entry per line. Change it to -1a if you want hidden files too

`| :` pipe output onto...

`wc:` "wordcount"

`-l:` count `l`ines.
